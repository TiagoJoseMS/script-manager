about=Script Manager provides a robust environment for managing, executing, and debugging PyQGIS scripts. Its core features include: a visual script browser with an integrated console to capture print() statements and errors in real-time; a safe execution environment that prevents script failures from crashing QGIS; pre-execution validation to warn against risky code; automatic file monitoring for instant reloading; and a quick access menu for routine tasks. With full Qt5/Qt6 compatibility and multi-language support (EN, PT-BR), it streamlines the development workflow for GIS professionals and developers.
